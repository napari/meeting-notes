### Last week's Agenda

- **:point_down: ADD YOUR AGENDA ITEMS HERE :point_down:**

- Isabela: more updates on [bundled app update UI](https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/4120)! I'll post a comment with our thoughts and any last updates after this meeting.
    - Still need to sort out how napari Info dialog and a proposed napari about dialog fit together (but this isn't a blocker for update development), what happens if there are no updates found, and making sure the Preferences proposal matches the rest of the experience.

- Juan: still looking for comments on [home page update PR, #4275](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/4275)
- Juan: new non-lfs approach to docs, issue made at [#4306](https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/4306).
- Isabela: will return to layer controls rearranging after bundle update dialog work is complete
    - Juan notes it would be great if we could either use font awesome icons or make icons for font awesome and then use it
    - Isabela notes this may be tricky because for accessibility purposes screenreaders may read the buttons as text (if the icons aren't rendering as images)  and that's confusing ([napari/napari #3136 Use font icons instead of SVGs](https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/3136) may be relevant)
    - Juan notes that it might not be an issue because Qt creates the UI element then adds things on top, so
    - 
- Greg and Juan note that we definitely need to unify transforms, highlighted by Greg's [recent PR](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/4303) which required changes in a lot more spots than it should have
- Discussion on plugins getting single file, list of files, folders and/or stack parameter
    - stack parameter will be pushed to plugins which is one way to address this
    - Juan thinks `stack` should be renamed (to something like `open_files_jointly`) and that should determine whether plugins get a list or not. 
    - We discussed that plugins taking lists makes the question of associating preferences even trickier
    - Juan's point is that if you really do want to associate a random assortment of files you should bundle them into a folder with an extension and this would disambiguate the preference
    - Draga notes that this might have unintended effects for users searching for plugins, if they see a random set of otherwise unknown file extensions
    - Juan notes that if you're trying to open such a specific set of files, you probably already know what plugin you're looking for
- Andy Boyd: trying to get users in electron microscopy to use it, but a key barrier is how difficult it can be to install
    - Juan reckons if they know python at all, then they should give it a go but failing that, they should wait probably just one version until the bundle provides update options
