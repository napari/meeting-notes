### Summary

- napari installation manager backend prototype is almost done. Next week there should be a complete prototype.
    - Plugin manager backend depends on that.
- napari plugin manager UI - what is still needed and what are thoughts on the [most recent request for a split drop down](https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/4952#issuecomment-1234029188)?
    - Mockup in progress; this proposal can work, but there are some questions if this is a) possible in Qt, b) if this makes sense with the plugin card UX on a higher-level c) which element of installation makes the most sense to have collapsed (tenative answer is the PyPI vs conda)
- Reviewing project board. Checking in on timeline.
- Gonzalo updates. Split between installation manager backend and "frontend tooling that isn't the UI"
- Pam updates. Getting up to speed with frontend work to prepare for plugin manager UI changes.
- Seeing an increase in issues based on mix ups with PySide2 or PyQt5 dependencies among plugin developers. How can we help support this ([there is documentation on best practices](https://napari.org/stable/plugins/best_practices.html))?
- Jaime update. Switching constructors needed to happen and is now a part of another project, so this will be happening without impacting the bundled app timeline.
