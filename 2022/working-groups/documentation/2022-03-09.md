### Agenda

- LFS Issues
    - quota exceeded, nothing is breaking, so it seems like it's our users' workflows which means bandwidth is unbounded
    - option: leverage Github's drag-and-drop interface
    - Juan gave demo of uploading
        - videos is 100MB limit
    - docs group is happy to go with this decision
    - next steps:
        1. wait for bandwidth to be restored
        2. migrate images to user-images.githubusercont.com via comments on a gist (get minified images from Matthias)
        4. kill git-lfs on the repo
        5. add instructions to docs contributor's guide
- content prioritization
    - home page
        - tech stack can go, but how pythonic do we want to make the software usage description
        - Juan wants to make it very clear that napari is designed to be used in conjunction with python
        - Don't want to "highlight" the app until it's able to update in place
            - there may actually be a longer list of asks here before we present app and library side by side
        - ideas for "buckets" of info
            - first up is just launching the viewer from python and showing off the viewer functionality
            - second is the tight python integration and bidirectionality
            - third is plugins + nascent bundled app
        - we really want to highlight the community support throughout the page
        - Chi-Li suggests using the top line nav as a way to "bucket" our home page
            - Usage -> viewer highlights
            - API -> python integration highlights
            - Plugins -> plugins
            - Community -> community 

### Next week's action items

- [ ] [name=Juan] Come up with 'wireframe' low fidelity proposal for main messages and components we want on the home page for community feedback
- [ ] Content prioritisation
