### Agenda

- Kyle: dask/vispy bug
    - async-proto: simple reproducing bug with dask delayed array wrapping numpy array
        - might be related to unassigned sizes
        - very large array (exceeding uint32)
    - main: may be able to reproduce on main
        - adding an extra dask config context manager helps?
- Kim: action JS review
    - non-qt and qt ASV artifacts are clobbering each other
    - can match multiple artifacts, then download and upload them with unique names
- Kyle: tiled-rendering
    - revisit TiledImageVisual and TextureAtlas2d, try to get it into vispy
    - hacky way to make tiled-rendering work with async proto?
    - may be able to hook into dask partial updates (as they come in), and just call refresh
    - Andy: or could drive data access with napari logic

### Action items

- Kim: combine small follow up PRs into one and put up for review
- Kyle: follow-up on dask/vispy bug, post to zulip accordingly
- Andy: update image slice PR to add a test that uses layer slicer to slice an image, communicate with async-dev
