### Agenda

- Async slicing PR
    - https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/5377
    - dask executor issues
        - may be a deeper issue: https://github.com/dask/distributed/issues/6087#issuecomment-1092615183
    - waiting for a few days for more feedback
- Progressive async slicing (tiled rendering)
    - early prototype phase still, but made some progress on 3D volumes
    - experimenting with multiple vispy nodes (instancing in vispy 0.12 may have solved some issues there)

### Action items

- Andy: experiment with PR for simple unification of slicing across layers
- Kyle: 3D chunked rendering
