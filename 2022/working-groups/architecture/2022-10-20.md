### Agenda

- Andy: image slice code review
    - https://github.com/napari/napari/compare/main...andy-sweet:async-slice-image-request?expand=1
    - Grzegorz: store inverse or use smarter caching mechanism for it
    - Long term fixes for improving transform chain performance
        - Maybe general fixes that could be useful
        - After async slicing is in we can get rid of tile2data as layer state. If we can also get rid of world2grid, then maybe we don't need a transform chain anymore?
- Andy: v0.4.17 release cherry picks / decisions
    - Fix new screenshot parameter: https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/5251
        - Yes, probably.
    - Fix theme / cache dir issues: https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/5248
        - Maybe. Needs more review.
    - Raise early for unsupported version combinations: https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/5244
        - Maybe. Needs more review.
    - mac ARM pyside2 issues: https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/5231
        - We don't have a fix yet, and don't entirely understand what's going wrong.
        - Qt does not officially support pyside2 (i.e. qt5) on mac ARM, so the long term fix is likely to migrate to pyside6 (qt6).
        - Decision: remove mac ARM bundle from v0.4.17 release, and instruct those mac users to install through conda or run with rosetta.
