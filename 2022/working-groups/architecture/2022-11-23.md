### Agenda

- Draft PR for async integration is up: https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/5353
    - What needs to happen to make this ready for review?
    - How safe is it to change the behavior of `Layer.refresh()`?
        - Based on search through zulip, we think that most people are calling refresh in the context of the viewer and redrawing.
        - So we thinking changing the behavior of refresh is pretty safe.
        - Some tests may need to be updated, but that's OK.
    - 
    - What should we do with `Layer.set_view_slice`?
        - Should we make this trigger async slicing too?

### Action items

- Andy/Eric: implement refresh as async when possible, and ensure sync route does what it should
