### Agenda

- Implementation plan
    - Layer slicer first (independently)
    - Image slice functionality (without change in behavior or performance)
    - Hook up layer slicer to viewer model (still sync by default)
    - Flip flag to start doing image slicing asynchronously (in some cases)
- Release plan
    - Waiting for review on https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/5190
    - Will likely pull in https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/5195
