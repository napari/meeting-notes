    - [Comments on git-lfs and summary of current workflow](https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/3529)
    - Things that are unclear: can we allow contributors to *not* install git-lfs? What happens if we want to remove git-lfs from the repo in the future? Bandwidth costs are also unclear.
    - Things that are unclear: what happens when you remove git-lfs from a repo and refer to a commit that was made with git-lfs?
