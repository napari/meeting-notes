# napari eurasia meeting 2022-09-21 9am CET

## Agenda
- 0.4.17rc2 release 
    - no conda bundle, but easy fix
    - docs links missing or broken
    - Lorenzo: some parts of the documentation should not be versioned
    - Grzegorz: we should label PRs that have breaking API changes. Automated tools: frappuccino, griffediff
    - Plugin community means napari breakages may leave many broken plugins
    - cookiecutter should put an upper limit on napari version (conda: run_constrained; pip?)
    - Plugin installer could be external to napari, but napari needs option to enable/disable plugins
    - switch to *real* semver pattern, which allows us to put upper limit in cookiecutter version for napari
- (maybe Lorenzo) Instanced rendering
- Lucy: Allowed plugin menu contribution points: https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/5079
- [add items here :point_up:]
