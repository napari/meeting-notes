### Agenda

- Kevin: reviving features/style work
    - some bandwidth to work on this in the near future
    - related to work needed on the lab
    - unsure what napari v0.5 is going to be
    - some time in next series of breaking releases, drop properties
    - motivation: a few use cases want to enable
        - graph layer (Jordao, Juan, Draga) is subclassing the points layer, and there is desire to use features + encodings there (so may need to add those to points)
        - direct label encodings (eric perlman), making 
        - want to add features for surface layer
    - challenges
        - labels layer
            - keeping features table in sync with data is generally difficult
            - removing label values is hard to detect (even with graphical interaction)
            - adding label values is easier to catch
    - tasks
        - deprecate properties
    - currently use some the napari functionality
        - so refactor would mostly make it cleaner
        - need for annotations + styling on surfaces
            - feels like others would want to use that

- Andy: upcoming metadata work
    - Trevor manz, Harvard: viv, vitesse (displays spatialomics data)
    - Viewer/camera state: have traditional scene graph schemata been looked at?
        - No, at least not for the OME-NGFF spec 0.5
    - John Bogovic
        - transformations spec on OME-NGFF (0.5)
        - https://github.com/ome/ngff/pull/138
    - napari-ome-zarr
        - probably pinned to the 0.3/0.4 spec
        - should be updated to meet the new spec
