### Agenda

- Andy: async settings and octree
    - add a new setting, deprecate old async/octree: https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/5609
    - remove most of old async/octree settings/code/tests: https://github.com/kcpevey/napari/pull/28/files
        - except classes that more tightly coupled (e.g. ImageSliceData), which will likely be removed as a follow up
