### Agenda

- Andy: usefulness, frequency (round 2)
    - original goal: share vision of what arch should be
    - on-demand?
    - office hours?
    - regular image.sc island office hours
        - group of core-devs, new contrib could grab one or two
    - consider cancelling the Thursday/euro meeting
        - people can still reach out on zulip and set up adhoc meetings
- Andy: resolve path forward on async integration (https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/5377)
    - WIP PR removes editable from slicing, but doesn't change the fundamental issue: https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/5546
    - WIP PR makes a base layer request, but also still needs a boolean: https://github.com/andy-sweet/napari/pull/41
    - Need to benchmark `Layer._make_slice_input` because if this is fast, then maybe we don't need to distinguish `_slice_dims` and `refresh` and can just call `_slice_dims`.

### Action items

- Andy:
    - Finish PR that removes editable from slicing: https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/5546
    - Change async integration PR to always call slice_dims and force in refresh path
    - Follow up on zulip about Thursday arch wg meeting
