### Agenda

- Andy: usefulness, frequency
    - Kyle: doesn't seem to get the right people for this topic
        - Want Juan, Grzegorz here
        - Could have a general techical meeting, or PR review meeting
    - Peter: some might be tight for time
        - May be revisiting meeting structure more generally
        - Maybe a separate (core) dev centric meeting (technical)
    - Eric: working group motivated because community meeting was crowded
        - But less so now
- Kyle: napari-hierarchical
    - progressive/tiled rendering/loading may have different loaders/renderers
        - gets more complex with 3D
    - open question about parameter values for choosing chunk loading strategies
    - build on top of napari-hierarchical
        - adding rendering strategy?
- Andy: async settings
    - Kyle: is it possible to make a setting not visible in the GUI?
    - This might make adding logic for mutally exclusive settings easier

### Action items

- Andy: follow up with async migration outreach
    - Ask question on settings and names
