### Agenda

- Andy: dask cache issue
    - 1. lock: only one thread can access the cache (https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/5610)
    - 2. reload instead of refresh: moves all internal slicing to the slicing thread
    - both solutions work for internal usage: (1) is simpler in terms of code changes, but maybe temporary too
    - neither solution works if user accesses dash array in their code
- Thick slices and changes to Dims
    - https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/5522

### Action items

- Andy: write PR that uses async refresh as much as possible, as alt/long-term workaround
- Juan: write PR to dask to make Cache thread safe
- Juan + Andy: summarize discussion on thick slices API
