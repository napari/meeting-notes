### Agenda

- Andy: async setting and octree
    - https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/5711
    - what about public API (e.g. napari.utils.config)?
        - this PR deprecates and defines some values. Could we just remove?
    - do we really want to keep the octree code?
        - i'm not convinced about discoverability
        - it might actually be easier to just refer to one PR when it comes to removal
    - we left the imageslice/loader/etc. simplification for a future PR, because that gets more complex
    - Layer.loaded should not be deprecated yet (until there's another part of the public API we can use to wait on async slicing), and we should implement it to return meangingful values
    - could remove other deprecated things like config.octree_loading, based on github CS
    - can remove octree code too if desired
- Andy: axis labels, dims
    - collected some issues related to dims to motivate more fundamental changes
