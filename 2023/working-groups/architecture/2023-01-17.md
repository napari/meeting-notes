### Agenda

- Andy: compare approaches for async slicing integration
    - Use refresh/slice_dims for sync layers: https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/5377
    - Define base layer request for sync layers: https://github.com/andy-sweet/napari/pull/41
    - Juan
        - consider returning immediate futures for sync tasks
            - Andy: maybe, but implementing this properly according to the spec of Future/Executor may have some nasty surprises (and thus may not be worth it)
        - prefer emitting slice result/response event in done callback to emitting it in task
            - Andy: something about time in between task completing and done callback being executed makes this a problem
    - Andy: main conclusion is that the force/refresh_sync parameter is not the real difference in these PRs (it is either needed in both or we need to make `slice_dims` and `refresh` effectively identical).
        - the real difference is that making a dummy/base layer request unifies the code path of sync/async, which now always trigger the slicer's ready/done event and always go through QtViewer._on_slice_ready
        
### Action items

- Juan: review https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/5413
- Andy: write PR to remove `Layers.events._ndisplay`
    - Done: https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/5491
- Andy: remember reason for moving event emission into task from done callback
    - The reason is the behavior of the function [`concurrent.futures.wait`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.wait)
        - This will return when the task finishes, which might be before the done callback is executed (and the event is emitted).
        - Sometimes we may want to wait for the event (e.g. if we want screenshot to always wait for async tasks to finish, the simplest approach is to wait for pending tasks, then process events on the main qt event loop).
