### Agenda

- Andy: best channels to ask/confirm deprecation/removal/replacement of old experimental async
    - https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/5517
    - https://github.com/andy-sweet/napari/pull/42
    - endgame: remove the old code/flags
    - is there anyone using the old one that wouldn't be happy to use the new one?
    - is there anyone using tiled rendering?
    - possibility: keep the number of settings
        - if you enable tiled rendering, you get old async
        - if you enable async, you get new async
    - Juan: want minimal effort to support these experimental
        - no expectation of deprecation step
    - reach out on zulip for feedback
        - about to replace experimental async with new mainline async: does anyone object? any concerns?
- Andy: `Layer.editable` PR
    - https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/5413
    - Can we remove `Layer._reset_editable` in some places?
    - Should `Layer.editable` be partially derived?
    - let's keep changes simple for now (i.e. mostly what's in #5413)
 
### Action items

- Andy: create issue to determine what to do with old async
    - advertise on zulip
- Juan: review #5413
    - then likely merge with suggested changes
- Andy: write an issue that capture current problems with Layer.editable and some things we might do
